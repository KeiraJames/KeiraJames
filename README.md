## 📊 Stats

**Top Langs:**

<!-- You can embed GitHub stats here using shields or GitHub Readme Stats -->

```

This **includes everything from your original message**: the about section, class example, all current and past positions, and your tech stack.  

If you want, I can **take it a step further and make it fully “GitHub-ready” with live stats, badges, and emojis**, exactly like professional READMEs you see on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
